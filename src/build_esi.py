build_esi.py -- Earth Science Informatics (Springer) submission package -> paper2/.

Builds the manuscript docx from the SHARED source (paper/CAGEO_manuscript.md, so the
science stays in sync with the Computers & Geosciences package) plus an ESI-addressed
cover letter. No Highlights file (Springer does not use them).

    para("Lagrangian particle tracking is a standard tool for studying the transport of "
         "floating material, but in inland lakes its use is blocked by the absence of "
         "ready-made forcing: global ocean reanalyses stop at the coast, and lake "
         "hydrodynamic models are built by hand, one waterbody at a time. This is a "
         "growing gap, because recent cross-national surveys show that lakes and "
         "reservoirs are among the most acutely plastic-polluted freshwater systems on Earth.")

    para("Our manuscript presents LakeForcing, an open and reproducible Python pipeline "
         "that assembles bathymetry and meteorology from open global datasets, "
         "automatically configures and runs a coupled Delft3D-FLOW + Delft3D-WAVE (SWAN) "
         "simulation for an arbitrary lake, and exports CF-compliant NetCDF that drives "
         "Lagrangian particle trackers without modification. The methodological core is a "
         "fully specified sigma-to-z coupling algorithm that bridges Delft3D's "
         "terrain-following sigma-layers to fixed metric z-levels, together with the "
         "curvilinear-to-regular regridding, velocity rotation and surface Stokes-drift "
         "derivation needed to make lake hydrodynamics interoperable with a generic "
         "tracker. We demonstrate the pipeline, unchanged, across twelve morphologically "
         "and climatically diverse lakes on all inhabited continents, from 36°S to 60°N.")

    para("We believe the work fits the scope of Earth Science Informatics as original "
         "research at the interface of computer science and the geosciences: it "
         "contributes a reusable algorithm and an openly released, reproducible software "
         "pipeline, demonstrated generality across twelve lakes, and full software and "
         "data availability. It addresses a concrete and timely computational barrier to "
         "environmental transport modelling in freshwater systems. The generality is "
         "supported by a same-group model-to-model consistency check against an expert-built "
         "reservoir model and by an independent comparison of the exported surface temperature "
         "against satellite observations for four further lakes. The complete source code is "
         "released under the MIT licence with a pinned software environment and a "
         "continuous-integration test that reproduces the sigma-to-z export from a clean "
         "checkout, and the twelve-lake forcing dataset is released openly as CF-1.8 NetCDF, so "
         "that the reported results are fully reproducible and the data are FAIR-interoperable.")
